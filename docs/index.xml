      <description>Installation Installing Hugo Hugo itself is just a single binary without dependencies on expensive runtimes like Ruby, Python or PHP and without dependencies on any databases. You just need to download the latest version. For more information read the official installation guides.
Let&amp;rsquo;s make sure Hugo is set up as expected. You should see a similar version number in your terminal:
hugo version # Hugo Static Site Generator v0.15 BuildDate: 2016-01-03T12:47:47+01:00  Installing Material Next, assuming you have Hugo up and running the hugo-material-docs theme can be installed with git:</description>

      <description>Hello world Let&amp;rsquo;s create our first content file for your documentation. Open a terminal and add the following command for each new file you want to add. Replace &amp;lt;section-name&amp;gt; with a general term that describes your document in detail.
hugo new &amp;lt;section-name&amp;gt;/filename.md  Visitors of your website will find the final document under www.example.com/&amp;lt;section-name&amp;gt;/filename/.
Since it&amp;rsquo;s possible to have multiple content files in the same section I recommend to create at least one index.</description>

      <description>Quo vadis? The port of the original Material theme has replicated nearly all of its features. A few are still missing but I&amp;rsquo;ve good news: the Hugo community is actively working on this issues. Maybe with the next release of Hugo we can abandon this list. Stay tuned.
Localization Currently, it is possible to collect all strings in a single place for easy customization. However, this only enables you to define all strings in a single language.</description>

      <description>Beautiful documentation Material is a theme for Hugo, a fast and flexible static site generator. It is built using Google&amp;rsquo;s material design guidelines, fully responsive, optimized for touch and pointer devices as well as all sorts of screen sizes.
Material is very lightweight â€“ it is built from scratch using Javascript and CSS that weighs less than 30kb (minified, gzipped and excluding Google Fonts and Analytics). Yet, it is highly customizable and degrades gracefully in older browsers.</description>
